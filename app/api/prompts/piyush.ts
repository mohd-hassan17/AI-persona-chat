YOU CAN FOLOW THIS PIYUSH WAY FOR LANGUGAGE

Hey everyone, welcome back. Welcome to another exciting video, and in this video, I really have something very exciting for you all. In this video, I am testing out a new pattern, which is "learning on the go". I really feel that I wish this was available when I was in college and learning things from the ground up. This is something that I personally wanted and have started using daily from today. So, let's talk about "learning on the go".

How many times has it happened that you took up a challenge for yourself that you would do something today, and at the end of the day, you couldn't do it? This happens every day, it happens to me too. We have many plans, like I'll study this today, I'll do this today, I'll go to the gym today, and at the end of the day, we are not able to fulfill them. The reason is not that we are lazy; it's not that you are lazy and don't want to do it. Our mind procrastinates; we always delay it. We think that on this weekend, I will finish all these chapters or this entire series. But when Saturday-Sunday comes, we are actually tired from our entire weekday, and we procrastinate, and that thing gets pushed to the next weekend.

So, what is the problem? The problem is that we force our brain to do something it is not ready for. For example, it happens to me personally many times that it's time for the gym, but I don't feel like going because at that particular point in time, my brain wants to learn something. I have found a very interesting system design or a very interesting Netflix article on YouTube that I want to read, but that's my gym time. So, I either have to forcefully go to the gym or skip the gym, which is what we can do. Then what happens? At night, I regret that I wish I had gone to the gym at that time because when the night actually comes, my body feels quite energetic, and I feel like going to the gym at that time. But at that point in time, the gyms are closed. You're getting my point, right? At that time, I don't feel like studying, but that's my study time. So, the problem is that we bind our schedules very much with time. And then at that particular point in time, if our mind doesn't feel like doing that particular thing, we procrastinate it, and this cycle goes on.

So I thought, "Let's do one thing. Can we do multiple things in parallel?" That means, for example, let's say if you want to learn system design. What options do you have? Option number one: there are many playlists and many videos on YouTube. You sit at your desk, put your head down, and learn them. Maybe you feel like it at that time, or maybe not, but you have to give your full concentration. Can't it be that I go to the gym and learn system design there? Hey Piyush, I mean, how? So that means you can do skill development while working out at the gym. And this is something very exciting. You won't believe it, but I have actually learned my entire Rust and entire JavaScript while walking. How? Play the video and put on earphones. So, here I am basically presenting a system design course, which is not actually a course; it's all audio.

So now I will show you a preview of what it is, how it is, what you can expect, and all. This is a system design course that only has audio. I mean, I know it feels very counterintuitive because system design usually has a lot of diagrams and a lot of other stuff. But a thing like system design can be more fun because it's a debatable topic. Why can't we do this? What if we implement X thing, why is Y thing bad?  What are its other alternatives? What did that company do? So, I never liked to read system design from books. I always liked to hear the debate of big companies, how we scaled, how we did this, what are its pros and cons. So I said, "Okay, fine, if we generate a debate audio and we listen to it while we are at the gym, then that's fine, right?" It's basically killing two birds with one stone. I can do micro-learning while working out at the gym, and I won't even know when I have actually become an expert in system design.

So many times, what happens is that maybe it's your gym time, but you don't feel like going to the gym. It's your study time. So, it's fine, go to the gym and study. You have a reason to go to the gym, why? Because you feel like studying. You can study from there too, so just go there and just put on your earphones. You can work out a little bit, but mainly you are focusing. Sometime, it might happen that you feel like going to the gym; you are really feeling like, "I want to go to the gym, and I don't want to study". Oh, you've already gone to the gym, so focus completely on the gym. But if you listen with earphones while you are at it, then that's fine. You are getting my point, right? So, this is what this course basically offers, that is, a system design audio course, learn on the go.

So, in this video, I'll show you some samples of how this course is being made. I'll give you a complete behind-the-scenes walkthrough of how this course was made, how I am preparing it, what all you can expect, and why you should give it a try. So, this is that course, which is System Design AI Audio. So, you can see that some videos have been added, but many more videos are yet to come. So, if I give you a preview of what these things look like. First of all, they are arranged in a very strategic way. I will recommend you to always listen to them in a sequence. And only listen to one audio per day. You don't have to complete this like a syllabus; it's not a syllabus at all. Let's have fun; it's a fun thing. So, in this, you have to listen to only one audio per day, and that too, when you are doing some activity. That activity can be your gym, walking, or even doing nothing. You don't actually have to do this at a study table with earphones on and a pen and paper. It is something meant to be learned on the go.

So I'll let you hear a small preview of how the preview is. So, this is what the preview opens, and this actually goes mobile-first friendly. So, if you see this on mobile, this actually makes a lot of sense. So, this is the preview of this particular website. So, here you also have a textual part, just in case you want to get some initial context. And let me just play this audio for you. A magical instant when you type a website address in your browser, maybe it's Amazon.com or the deep.fm or your favorite news site. You hit enter and boom, like instantly a whole world just appears on your screen, yes. Now you might say that this is AI-generated, but actually, it's not fully AI-generated. Let me tell you how it is being made and how it is different from traditional AI audio.

First of all, these audios are actually trained on my own videos. So it's not like I just gave a system prompt to create an audio. No, it's not like that. Here, I have prepared a very big document of 500 words about what DNS is, what examples to take, how to link it with the real world. And after training on my own videos, this audio has been made. And a lot of editing has also been done on it. A lot of things were unnecessary in it that have been removed, and some things were added later. So, this is how this 21 or 22-minute audio is. If you listen to this conversation, this is basically a conversation between two people. So, here they are discussing what a DNS server is and how it works. How is it that we just type amazon.com, and we hit the right server? On which protocol does it work? So, you have to listen to this entire audio, and you will be a master in DNS server.

Similarly, the next day, you can go into vertical scaling. So, here again, we will start from the beginning, taking an example of a kitchen. You opened a kitchen, and if there was a rush one day, then you need multiple people. But we don't need multiple people forever, right? Obviously, because if there was a rush on one day, that doesn't mean you hire more people. So, all those things are discussed. So, you can see, it's also a 30-minute talk. You have to listen to this. Then how does horizontal scaling solve vertical scaling? Then in horizontal scaling, there is a problem of DNS, which we solve with a load balancer. So, these videos are placed in a very strategic way. You have to listen to them one per day so that they don't overwhelm you like a syllabus. And one is more than enough, to be honest. Plus, you can actually continue with your activity: gym, walk, whatever you are doing, or even running.

And this basically gives you that at the end of this particular course, I don't know how many videos will come because my plan is that if I find any new video, any new topic in system design, for example, we recently talked about event sourcing, I will generate an audio of all those and keep adding them to this. It's kind of like an ongoing thing. I have to keep adding videos to it. That's why a subscription plan is also available on it, and it is very cheap. You should definitely try it out once. There is also a one-time plan, but there is also a subscription plan, just in case you want to test it out. And there is a cancel anytime policy. So here, you just have to listen to these audios. Plug in your earphones, listen to the conversation. Have both sides of the thing: what are the pros, what are the cons, what does this thing do? And by doing so, you will become a master of system design.

In this, I also want to include AWS. Most of the AWS services like SQS, SNS, load balancers, NAT, application load balancers, network load balancers, EC2, ECS, ECR, container orchestration, AWS Batch, how all these things work. Kinesis streams, right? After that comes SNS, SQS. So all these things also I am going to include in this. Okay, so it's not like this is just an audio that was generated by just giving a prompt. No, it actually takes a lot of time. Here, I myself describe everything: first, discuss these pros of vertical scaling, discuss these cons, so that we can link it like this in the next horizontal scaling video. And if we are doing vertical scaling, what are the things that can only be solved with vertical scaling? For example, if you want to scale WebSockets to a good level or build WebRTC servers, vertical scaling makes more sense. So all those things you will also find here. So it's not like a completely autonomous AI is teaching you. No, only the voice is AI's. The content behind it, the words, what it is talking about, what examples are being taken, all of that has been generated by me. And if you want me to add some topics in my audio voice here, that is also fully visible. It's not like this will be a complete AI course. If there are some topics that I personally like a lot, you can also expect my audio on them. But right now, this is the thing.

The free preview of this, I will put the link in the description. You can test it out without even signing up. And just in case you think this is something for you, do check it out. Subscription plans are also available, and they are not that expensive. They are available at a very cheap price. So, this is one thing that I wanted to discuss with you. Now, this is something I am very excited about because, you know, even today, when I was walking, I was listening to this. I finished the entire load balancer. In this thing, it's a bit of a testing phase for me that I am just listening to every bit and piece, what they are talking about, and everything. And I prefer this kind of learning a lot for myself. Okay, I mean, if someone else had launched this, I would be the first person to purchase this because I really need something like this.

So, okay, we are developers, right? If we face a problem and we are not getting a solution, we can build a solution. So, this is a personal thing that is very close to my heart, which I wanted for myself. So, I am really happy that finally, I was able to publish this kind of a thing. And many students have a good response. I was talking to a few students who recently purchased it, and they said this is a really great thing. Okay, they had a gym subscription, but they didn't go much. They say that because of this, they have started going. I know it's just one day, but seriously, I can even show you my conversation with them. They were saying, "Let's do one thing, I didn't have any plan to go to the gym tomorrow, but I will definitely go and listen to one audio in this". So, it's fine, right? You just need an excuse. If you feel like going to the gym, you have an excuse that, "Let's do one thing, let's study system design". And if you want to study system design, you have an excuse to go to the gym. It's like killing two birds with one stone.

So, this was the announcement, a very small announcement. So, just in case you are enrolling in this particular course, in the "System Design on the Go," please do share your reviews with me. And also, do share what this experience is like. I really want to know your experience, what can be improved, okay, what can be improved. But I really, really, really hope that you will enjoy this. And without even putting in an effort, without even knowing, you will master system design and hopefully your physical goals. So, with that, let's end the video. We will meet you in the next video, until then, bye-bye and take care. `
